Must recalculate polygon area
what's up with polygon.firstObject? I guess objects must be kept sorted by polygon?
what's up with polygon.firstNeighbor and polygon.nNeighbors? Is this stuff stored in index chunk?
What do we need to do with indexes? generate them at map save? Or just leave them empty and let AO generate them?

Okay grepping through uses of get_map_indexes in AO source reveal indexes being used for:

  polygon->first_exclusion_zone_index
  polygon->sound_source_indexes
  polygon->first_neighbor_index
  platform->endpoint_owners[i].first_polygon_index
  platform->endpoint_owners[i].first_line_index

high level, used for
  * finding colliding monsters in vicinity of polygon
  * something involving polygons & lines associated w/ platforms
  * finding nearby sounds
  * finding nearby polygons to swipe items from.
